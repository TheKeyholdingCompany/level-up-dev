# Level up your programming knowledge

## üëã Intro
So you want to learn how to code? Great! That could mean a hundred different things, from changing career paths, to adding some automation to your current job, to making a snazzy dashboard for your team. 
The good news is that this is a living, adaptable guide that can change with your feedback and what you want to learn. Even better, you have the power to change and edit it too (but we'll get to that later).

This isn't a guide that will hold your hand step by step, there are a thousand places on the internet that can do that better. This guide will give an explanation of a concept (and how that might relate to us), some links to go and read more about it, then a piece of 'homework' for you to exercise your new found knowledge. If you'd like help around a cetain topic, let us know and we can add it.

## ü§ù Help 
You don't just learn by following online guides though! Sometimes something might just not click, or some pesky code you've written just won't compile. Take a visit over to #level-up-dev on our Slack where our resident devs can help you with anything you need a hand with. No question too big or small. You can learn from us, and we can learn what to write in this guide!

## üöÄ Getting started
Do you have a text editor on your computer? Then you're already there! Our developers use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as their editor of choice as it has a lot of features geared towards writing code.

Create a new file and write:
```
<html>
  <h1>My first website</h1>
  <p>Woop woop</p>
</html>
```
Save as `index.html` then drag it on top of your web browser of choice. Congrats, you've made your very first website. Easy peas. Now it's time to get learning!

## üìñ Index
If you're just getting started, we recommend starting from the top and working your way down.
